#QC of sequence reads

Technical quality of library construction and sequencing run was tested using fastQC

```{bash}
fastqc --version

CPU=4
fastQC_outdir="./fastqc_ChIP-seq/"
fastq_dir="./FASTQ_ChIP-seq/"

mkdir -p "${fastQC_outdir}"
ls -1 "${fastq_dir}" | grep .fastq.gz$ > FASTQ_files
fastq_files=`cat FASTQ_files`
for i in ${fastq_files};
do
	fastqc --outdir "${fastQC_outdir}" --threads "${CPU}" "${fastq_dir}${i}"
done
```
