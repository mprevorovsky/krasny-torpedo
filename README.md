Code for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data analyses for the manuscript "The Torpedo Effect in Bacillus subtilis: RNase J1 Resolves Stalled Transcription Complexes"

## RNAP ChIP-seq analysis files:
**ChIP-seq.Rmd** - analysis workflow from FASTQ reads to normalized gene-level coverage data (Rmarkdown)
ChIP-seq.html - report from running the workflow
shell_variables_ChIP-seq.sh

## RNA-seq analysis files:
**RNA-seq.Rmd** 
RNA-seq.html 
shell_variables_RNA-seq.sh

## gene classification based on RNAP occupancy and gene expression in rnjA KO
**classes.Rmd**	- classification criteria and code
